## üìù Problem Statement <p id="bquestions"></p>

Zomato is an Indian restaurant aggregator and food delivery start-up founded by Deepinder Goyal and Pankaj Chaddah in 2008. Zomato provides information, menus and user-reviews of restaurants, and also has food delivery options from partner restaurants in select cities.

India is quite famous for its diverse multi cuisine available in a large number of restaurants and hotel resorts, which is reminiscent of unity in diversity. Restaurant business in India is always evolving. More Indians are warming up to the idea of eating restaurant food whether by dining outside or getting food delivered. The growing number of restaurants in every state of India has been a motivation to inspect the data to get some insights, interesting facts and figures about the Indian food industry in each city. So, this project focuses on analysing the Zomato restaurant data for Hyderabad city of India.

The Project focuses on Customers and Company, you have to analyze the sentiments of the reviews given by the customer in the data and made some useful conclusion in the form of Visualizations. Also need to build a recommendation system for zomato to recommend the alike restaurants given the restaurant name based on user reviews

Zomato's recommendation system can help their business by making it easier for customers to find restaurants they like.

This can also help Zomato make more money by connecting customers with restaurants that they might order food from. And, by understanding what customers like, Zomato can stay ahead of other companies and keep being a good choice for people looking for a place to eat.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a method used to analyze and summarize datasets, in order to gain insights and understand the underlying structure of the data. It typically involves visualizing the data, computing basic statistics and identifying patterns, outliers, and relationships between variables.
